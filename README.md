# Designing a Quiz on coding using Web API

This week's assignment is to create an online quiz about coding from scratch using HTML, CSS and Web API. This quiz is a multiple choice quiz with a starting page, four code related questions, an end page where the quiz taker can input their initials and a final high score page where all the high scorer's initials and score will be displayed, and can be cleared if needed.


## Installation

The profile can be accessed through my GitHub Repository via the following link:
