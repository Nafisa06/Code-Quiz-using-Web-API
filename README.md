# Designing a Quiz on coding using Web API

This week's assignment is to create an online quiz from scratch using HTML, CSS and Web API. This quiz is a multiple choice quiz with a starting page, four code related questions, an end page where the quiz taker can input their initials and a final high score page where all the high scorer's initials and score will be displayed, and can be cleared if needed.

Each question has 4 choice options. The options change from purple to green if it was the correct answer, or turns red if it was the incorrect answer.

Once the quiz has been completed, the quiz taker will be directed to the end page where their score will be displayed and they can enter their initials to record their score.
